## Abstract
Many Saudi people want to buy land in Riyadh city for investment, personal use but they donâ€™t know the future of this investment so, the goal of iAQAR is to use linear regression models to predict the Land price to help people to invest in the right place.

## Design
The data is scrapped from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Justice website and it represents the sales deals of lands in Riyadh in the last 11 years and the goal was to analysis it to answer these three main questions

> What is the housing price in riyadh in the next 5 years? </br>
> Is the price increasing each year? </br>
> What is the price growth for each year?



## Data Description:
* Datasets with description: </br>
This project based on the data availabile on the ministy of justice website:

> The land prices are scrapped from: https://www.moj.gov.sa/ar/opendata/bi/birealestate/Dashboards/100_kpiDistrict/101_Monthly/kpi101_04.aspx. <br />


## Scope of the work
Sample size:

>  11 years scrapped (2010 to 2021) worth of data will be used for the analysis, and the reason is to make a robust model for the future predections.

> Only riyadh city will be involved in this project.

Description for the datset as num of rows, number of features/columns, names of columns with description:

Description of scrapped data: </br>

> Number of features:  8 features/Columns

> Number of rows: Approx.: 600K rows

## Algorithms

*Data gathering*:
> 1) Web scrapped the data from ministy of justice website
> 2) helper tools:
> >     1- BeautifulSoup
> >     2- Selenium

*Data cleaning*:
> 1) Deleteing the duplicated data points
> 2) Dealing with outliers using IQR
> 3) Deleting some inaccurate Neighborhoods

*Data validation*:
> 1) Checking no nulls
> 2) Checking datatypes


*feature engineering*:
Features add:
 > 1)  Change date to numeric value
 > 2)  Year
 > 3) Yearly/Area
 > 4) Categorical values are changed to one label  encoder
